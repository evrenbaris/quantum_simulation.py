# Quantum Circuit Simulation

## Overview
This project demonstrates a basic quantum circuit simulation using Qiskit. It applies a Hadamard gate to a qubit to create a superposition state and visualizes the measurement results as a histogram.

## Features
- Create a simple quantum circuit with 1 qubit and 1 classical bit.
- Apply the Hadamard gate to put the qubit into superposition.
- Simulate the circuit using Qiskit's AerSimulator.
- Visualize measurement results.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries:
  - `qiskit`
  - `matplotlib`

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install qiskit qiskit-aer matplotlib
